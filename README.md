# Schumacher Clean (clR8x8)

This font is originally from 1989 by Dale Schumacher. It is an X11 bitmap font distributed, on my system, in the package `xorg-fonts-misc`.

I added the correct Unicode codepoints everywhere called for, and converted it to an OpenType Bitmap (`.otb`) font with [`bitmapfont2otb`](https://github.com/ctrlcctrlv/bitmapfont2otb).
